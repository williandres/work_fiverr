# Riddles
I love riddles. I couldn't find a good enough collection across the internet, so I made one in my [Python RPG](github.com/crawsome/pyRPG_mini). Now, I'm offering this for free in hopes of it getting bigger and better. 

Please [Contribute to me](https://colinburke.com/contribute) if this helped you!

Thank you!

## Disclaimer:
* The dataset isn't perfect and needs pruning, and needs more riddles. Help me by submitting a pull request, or an issue!
* I didn't write these. These are from all around the internet. LMK if you find an unsavory or terrible riddles. 
* Please submit pull requests to add riddles. 

## TODO: Create a script that generates all files in repo:
* CSV
* Text
* sqlite3 database
* TBA (As requested)
* Some metadata for the riddles would be awesome. Riddle type. Answer Type. Difficulty rating. There's a lot of possibilities here. 

## What are Riddles? They're not Jokes
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddle

### Riddles are **Enigmas**
Problems in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking
* YES to Logic, to a degree.
* YES Philosophy

### Riddles are also **Conduras**
Questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer
* YES Puns
* YES Wordplay
* YES Double-meanings and synonyms

### Technicalities:
Technicalities go here. Weird off-case stuff. 
* No integers or symbols, make your answers in words only. One. Two. Three. Plus, Minus. 

### Don't put these in the dataset: 
* One-liners 
* Fun Facts / "Did you know"
* Life-pro-tips
* Boomer humor / cliche / antihumor / cringe / racism / cruel / sexual or alluding to sexual humor
* Riddles cannot be associated with each other or cross-refernce each other to be completed. 
* * *"I'm the answer to #31 and #56 in the pulural sense"*
* No long riddles. [Nate the Snake](https://web.archive.org/web/20200329123356/https://natethesnake.com/) was a fun read, but that's not what this is for, lol. 
* [No riddles that require a truth table to solve!](http://brainden.com/forum/topic/373-the-liar-the-truth-tellerand-the-random-answerer/)
* I would argue against esoteric and domain knowledge jokes, they should belong in their own dataset IMHO. 
* * *"Why did the waterfall circult never blow out under load? Because he made preparations to diode!"*
